# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.1.0-alpha.35

- Migrate repository, installation and update URLs to ridd1e1337 on GitHub.
- Validate shell syntax and isolated update tests locally; remote VPS acceptance is unavailable.

## 0.1.0-alpha.34

- Add opt-in live subscriptions with stable token URLs, finite or revocable
  non-expiring access, ID-based revocation, and optional HTTPS entry URLs.
  Existing snapshot subscriptions retain their original behavior.
- Publish one atomic live generation after successful state transactions;
  node/user changes and credential rotation update both sing-box profiles and
  Sub-Store links. Publication failure rolls back the state transaction.
- Change Sub-Store node synchronization to a reusable live source, and add
  remote source registration, checks, removal, and automatic collection
  membership. Preserve source processors and collection order/settings;
  failed registration restores previous definitions where the API is available.
- Add panel controls for remote sources and live subscription creation/status/
  revocation. Bypass source caching so client subscription refreshes retrieve
  current nodes; Sub-Store is only required on the aggregation server.
- Add isolated live-feed and real Sub-Store merge/failure tests, including
  Alpine 3.21–3.24 and low-privilege feed access. Remote VPS acceptance remains
  pending because no test host is available.

## 0.1.0-alpha.33

- Keep panel pages open after actions, cancellations, and failures; preserve
  the selected node and return one submenu level at a time. Validate menu
  choices, support q to cancel ordinary input, and exit cleanly on EOF.
- Run panel actions in fresh Bash workers so backend failures stop execution
  without terminating the menu. Reload after manager updates, exit after
  completed uninstall, and preserve global execution/color options.
- Add numbered selectors for quota groups, members, interfaces, Tunnel routes,
  and compatible benchmark records, with readable operation summaries.
- Retain existing node/group/route/settings values and Sub-Store ports during
  edits; allow clearing optional metadata and route paths. Suggest available
  proxy ports and listener-aware client addresses.
- Add isolated PTY coverage for failures, cancellation, nested navigation,
  node edits, update/reload, uninstall, and option propagation. Verify Alpine
  3.21–3.24 interactions; remote Debian/VPS acceptance remains pending because
  no test host is available.

## 0.1.0-alpha.32

- Add bounded iperf3 throughput tests, protected history, and comparison of
  runs with matching endpoints, direction, duration, and stream count.
- Add authenticated SOCKS5, HTTP, and mixed nodes with loopback defaults,
  multi-user credentials, exports, templates, and panel controls. Block dynamic
  SOCKS UDP forwarding when port-based traffic policies are enabled so it
  cannot bypass node or shared quotas.
- Add node expiry/renewal with scheduled suspension, preserved credentials,
  and deduplicated expiry notifications.
- Add shared node quotas with independent billing cycles, nftables enforcement,
  retained group usage, backups, and threshold alerts.
- Add optional tc HTB/fq_codel shaping for direct-node downstream traffic on
  one selected interface, with queue ownership checks and restore support.
- Add locally managed Cloudflare credentials and multi-host/path ingress
  routes validated by Cloudflared before service activation.
- Add native Sub-Store frontend/backend installation with verified Release
  digests, systemd/OpenRC services, node synchronization, transactional updates,
  dedicated backups, and integration with full manager backups.
- Add isolated fault injection and Alpine 3.21–3.24 coverage, plus real proxy,
  Sub-Store, Cloudflared, iperf3, tc, and nftables tests. Remote VPS acceptance
  remains pending because no test host is available.

## 0.1.0-alpha.31

- Add bandwidth/RTT-based TCP buffer planning and tuning with memory/cgroup
  caps, readback verification, protected backups, retryable rollback, restore,
  conflict reporting, CLI JSON/dry-run output, and panel controls.
- Add bounded IPv4/IPv6 latency, packet-loss, and RTT-jitter diagnostics using
  local iputils/BusyBox ping, with JSON output and a panel entry.
- Keep TCP tuning independent of BBR and Hysteria2 UDP settings; restore its
  original values before uninstalling. Support Alpine/BusyBox/OpenRC alongside
  Debian/systemd without changing proxy state or installing another kernel.
- Add isolated fault-injection tests and an Alpine container smoke suite.
  Remote Debian acceptance is pending because no test host is available.

## 0.1.0-alpha.30

- Export single-user Snell v5 to Surge, mihomo, sing-box, and Sub-Store, and
  make v5 the compatibility-first default for newly created nodes.
- Export single-user Snell v6 to supported Surge Beta/TestFlight and sing-box
  clients while clearly excluding unsupported mihomo targets.
- Print copyable Sub-Store single-node entries and serve a dedicated mixed
  Sub-Store subscription format instead of relying on unsupported `snell://`
  parsing.
- Add a real local Snell end-to-end handshake to `sb probe` and print the
  required Surge Beta/TestFlight version and cloud TCP-port reminder for v6.
- Fix manager self-updates started from an installer-launched interactive panel
  failing against the setup lock inherited from their own parent installer.

- Add `sb update --check` and `sb update` for self-updating the manager while
  preserving nodes, secrets, certificates, backups, and the current core.
- Make repeated installs reuse the existing core by default when the requested
  version is unchanged, and add the internal `--keep-core` upgrade path.
- Record the immutable source commit and repository during bootstrap so update
  checks are reproducible.

- Fix Alpine/BusyBox bootstrap installs exiting while resolving the latest
  commit because `grep|head` could trigger a SIGPIPE under `pipefail`.
- Fix Alpine/OpenRC services failing to bind port 443 on VPS/container kernels
  that expose file capabilities but do not apply them to unprivileged users.
- Fix Alpine status checks missing listeners whose `ss -p` process name is the
  gcompat dynamic loader (`ld-musl`/`ld-linux`).

- Resolve the default sing-box version from the newest non-draft GitHub
  Release at install/update time; use the verified `1.14.0-rc.4` asset map
  only when the Release API is unavailable.
- Make Alpine installation default to a disk-friendly `minimal` dependency
  profile; defer Python, nftables, kmod, dcron, Nginx, and other optional
  components until the corresponding feature is used.
- Stop downloading Cloudflared during normal installation. Add explicit
  `sb cloudflared install|status` commands and retain existing Tunnel
  installations across upgrades.
- Bound cached core and program-upgrade backups and add free-space checks before
  large core downloads, with dedicated Alpine/OpenRC minimal-install coverage.
- Add the complete Go `sb-manager-web` project development specification, including repository boundaries, CLI integration, Web API, Agent enrollment, security, deployment, testing, and phased milestones.
- Start the independent Go `sb-manager-web` repository with SQLite storage, embedded WebUI, local/remote task APIs, Agent enrollment, and systemd/OpenRC deployment.
- Make the default installation and `sb core update` resolve the newest non-draft GitHub sing-box Release (including prereleases); retain `--core-version` for reproducible pinning.
- Add one-click BBR enable/status/restore commands and panel controls with transactional sysctl backup and rollback.
- Add one-click Hysteria2 UDP buffer tuning (`rmem_max`/`wmem_max` 16 MiB) with panel/CLI status, backup, restore, and rollback.
- Raise the default/tested sing-box core from 1.14.0-rc.1 to 1.14.0-rc.2 so new Snell v6 nodes work immediately after installation.
- Add sing-box 1.14 Hysteria2 Gecko obfuscation with configurable packet sizes and the Chrome QUIC fingerprint switch.
- Add `sb core schema [FILE]` and an interactive panel action for exporting the schema generated by the installed 1.14 core.
- Add 1.14 optimistic DNS caching and per-query DNS timeout settings with CLI/panel controls and 1.13-safe rendering.
- Expose Hysteria2 1.14 BBR profiles and Brutal debug logging in the node wizard, templates, and client exports.
- Add a loopback-safe `sb api cli` wrapper and a corresponding API/Dashboard panel menu.
- Add 1.14 TUN DNS mode/address controls to client exports and the interactive panel, while retaining 1.13-safe defaults.
- Add `sb core capabilities [--json]` and a panel view of sing-box build tags and compiled 1.14 feature support.
- Document the complete 1.14 feature coverage matrix and the separate-model boundary for Realm/VPN/desktop-only features.
- Add Snell v6 traffic-shaping mode with v5 compatibility selection, version-aware exports, migration defaults, and panel/CLI controls.
- Add Hysteria Realm rendezvous service with protected token storage, TLS/loopback configuration, Hysteria2 node linkage, NAT traversal options, panel controls, and preview-core coverage.

## 0.1.0-alpha.27

- Standardize script-facing global CLI options (`--json`, `--yes`, `--dry-run`, `--quiet`, `--no-color`) and usage-error exit code 2.
- Add `sb config validate|diff` with redacted candidate previews and dry-run support for node and traffic policy edits.
- Add non-secret node templates plus atomic tag/region batch enable/disable operations.
- Add resource metrics (disk, inode, memory, load, file descriptors, Fail2ban bans, service restarts) and feed threshold/security changes into the existing notification channel.
- Add certificate-renewal failure notifications and `sb doctor --repair-safe` / `sb repair --safe` low-risk recovery.

## 0.1.0-alpha.26

- Add a unified `sb status` dashboard and machine-readable `sb status --json` output covering services, nodes, traffic, certificates, firewall, notifications, and health issues.
- Add protected Telegram, WeCom, and generic Webhook notifications with deduplicated traffic quota thresholds and periodic health-change alerts.
- Add SSH listener discovery, UFW change preview/safe setup, and automatic allowance of detected SSH ports alongside web and protocol ports.
- Add node metadata (remark, region, purpose, line, tags) with CLI/panel editing and tag/region filtering.
- Add optional systemd/OpenRC periodic health checks with certificate expiry, listener, service, firewall, Fail2ban, and nftables diagnostics.

## 0.1.0-alpha.25

- Add explicit firewall-panel and CLI setup for Fail2ban SSH protection (180-second window, five failures, permanent bans) and UFW installation/enablement with TCP 22, 80, 443, and active protocol ports allowed.
- Snapshot existing iptables/UFW status and Fail2ban configuration before setup, with idempotent component status reporting and Debian/RPM/Alpine/OpenRC package-manager coverage.

## 0.1.0-alpha.24

- Add node-level upload/download accounting, UTC monthly total/download quotas, and directional nftables rate ceilings without taking over the host's `tc` qdisc.
- Persist traffic policy in normalized schema-v2 node state and accumulated usage in a protected journal, with transactional rollback, backup/restore, systemd/OpenRC boot recovery, periodic checkpoints, diagnostics, CLI, and panel integration.

## 0.1.0-alpha.23

- Extend Nginx Stream SNI multiplexing to Alpine/OpenRC with `apk` dependency installation, supervised foreground service output, persistent low-port capability handling, and OpenRC diagnostics/rollback/uninstall coverage.
- Verify real Nginx Stream startup on Alpine 3.21, 3.22, 3.23, and 3.24, plus the complete Alpine 3.23 installer/OpenRC smoke path with official sing-box and cloudflared assets.

## 0.1.0-alpha.22

- Include the setup-time Snell renderer load fix and final Debian firewall regression coverage.

## 0.1.0-alpha.21

- Make sing-box 1.14.0-rc.1 the primary tested core and resolve latest core updates from the newest official release, including prereleases.
- Add explicit firewall/port management commands for protocol port inspection, UFW allow rules, and backed-up INPUT deny cleanup.

## 0.1.0-alpha.20

- Include the final Snell preview-core fixes and regression coverage in the published release.

## 0.1.0-alpha.19

- Generate random persistent Naive usernames for new users and credential rotations while preserving existing usernames until rotation.

- Add regression coverage for the Naive username/password mapping.

## 0.1.0-alpha.16

- Default VLESS Reality SNI and handshake target to `www.apple.com` while retaining custom domain prompts and CLI values.

## 0.1.0-alpha.15

- Use the numbered node selector for the panel's share-link and client-export action, with an explicit all-nodes option.
- Document certificate reuse separately from listener-port reuse and clarify the direct TCP/UDP and Nginx Stream constraints.

## 0.1.0-alpha.14

- Keep Reality SNI and ShadowTLS handshake targets separate from the client endpoint: omitted endpoints now use the detected public IPv4.

## 0.1.0-alpha.13

- Apply the selected outbound IP strategy to both server direct outbounds and exported client configurations.

## 0.1.0-alpha.12

- Prefer a node's configured domain as the default client address; address-only nodes now default to the detected public IPv4.
- Replace manual node-ID hunting in the panel with numbered node selection while retaining manual ID entry.
- Add global client outbound IP strategies: IPv4 preferred, IPv6 preferred, and IPv4 only.

## 0.1.0-alpha.11

- Show valid issued certificates as numbered choices when adding AnyTLS, Hysteria2, Trojan, TUIC, VLESS TLS, and NaiveProxy nodes.
- Default to the first available certificate while retaining manual domain entry and a cancel option.
- Ask for the VLESS security mode before requesting a TLS certificate or Reality SNI.

## 0.1.0-alpha.10

- Use the managed ACME home/config/certificate directories for issue, install, and renewal operations instead of silently falling back to `/root/.acme.sh`.
- Migrate existing root-owned acme.sh domain material and account metadata during upgrade, while keeping Cloudflare credentials in the sb-manager secret file.
- Treat acme.sh's exit code 2 for an in-window renewal skip as an idempotent issue operation.

## 0.1.0-alpha.9

- Fix an ACME deployment deadlock caused by the reload hook re-entering `state_init` while certificate issuance held the manager lock.
- Fix strict-shell expansion in `cert hook` and `cert inspect`, and add bounded issue/install/cron timeouts with transactional rollback.
- Add remote Debian regression coverage for a reload hook invoked while the manager lock is held and for ACME timeout handling.

## 0.1.0-alpha.8

- Add optional Debian/systemd Nginx Stream SNI passthrough for sharing one public TCP port across AnyTLS, Trojan, VLESS TLS/Reality, Naive TCP, and ShadowTLS v3.
- Move routed sing-box listeners to unique loopback backends while preserving their direct ports for lossless disable/rollback and publishing the mux port in links and client exports.
- Add CLI/panel management, strict SNI/route validation, unknown-SNI rejection, systemd sandboxing, diagnostics, backup compatibility, and transactional activation rollback.
- Validate real SNI routing, TLS passthrough, service restart, failure rollback, and disable restoration on the designated Debian 13 server.

## 0.1.0-alpha.7

- Add Trojan TLS, TUIC, VLESS TLS/Reality, NaiveProxy, and ShadowTLS v3 protocol modules with per-user credentials and validated client exports.
- Add schema-v2 state migration, transactional rollback across state/config/secrets/certificates/subscriptions, hardened restore checks, and optional age-encrypted backups.
- Add loopback-only expiring subscriptions, gated sing-box 1.14 API/Dashboard support, complete mixed/TUN exports, public-address source tracking, and `sb probe` network diagnostics.
- Pin remote bootstrap installs to an explicit immutable ref and add release provenance, checksum, and optional GPG signature artifacts.
- Validate all changes on the designated Debian 13 test server against official sing-box 1.13.19 and 1.14.0-rc.1 binaries.

## 0.1.0-alpha.6

- Retry all core download failures with bounded backoff instead of relying on curl's limited default retry classes.
- Stop immediately after a failed or empty download and remove partial files before checksum or extraction steps.
- Validate GitHub Release API responses and propagate lookup failures without silently converting `latest` into an invalid version.
- Add deterministic retry/fail-fast coverage while retaining the real first-download smoke test.

## 0.1.0-alpha.5

- Allow `AF_NETLINK` in the hardened systemd address-family policy so sing-box can subscribe to Linux route updates during startup.
- Add a real transient systemd startup preflight using the rendered sing-box configuration; the previous `version` check could not detect route-monitor failures.
- Extend `sb doctor` with an explicit AF_NETLINK policy check and extend `sb repair` with the real startup preflight.
- Add unit and real PID-1 systemd regressions that start an actual sing-box inbound under the production sandbox.

## 0.1.0-alpha.4

- Fix systemd `203/EXEC` / `Permission denied` failures caused by stale sing-box file capabilities left by an OpenRC-style installation or migration.
- Make sing-box capability handling backend-specific: systemd receives `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` only through the unit, while OpenRC keeps the minimal file capability.
- Add a transient systemd sandbox preflight before starting the permanent service, using the same critical user, capability and hardening properties.
- Stop an existing restart loop before replacing service definitions and limit repeated systemd startup failures to five attempts per minute.
- Extend `sb doctor` and `sb repair` to detect, explain and safely repair file-capability, path-permission, mount and systemd sandbox execution problems.
- Ensure core download, update, switch and rollback all normalize executable permissions and capabilities for the active service backend.
- Add Debian/systemd regression coverage for capability cleanup and sandbox preflight.

## 0.1.0-alpha.3

- Add a systemd/OpenRC service abstraction for start, stop, enable, status, logs, repair, Tunnel management, and uninstall.
- Add OpenRC supervised services for sing-box and cloudflared, plus `dcron` periodic jobs for core updates, ACME renewal, and Quick Tunnel refresh.
- Keep sing-box unprivileged on OpenRC by applying only `cap_net_bind_service` to installed cores for low-port listeners.
- Add portable account/group, DNS lookup, and certificate-expiry helpers for musl/BusyBox environments.
- Add OpenRC lifecycle tests and Alpine 3.21/3.22/3.23/3.24 musl smoke jobs using the real official sing-box and cloudflared assets.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2

- Fix first installation requiring a second run: download progress logs no longer contaminate the binary path captured by command substitution.
- Validate generated sing-box/cloudflared symlink targets before installation continues.
- Repair non-traversable core directories so the low-privilege `sbmanager` account can execute the cores.
- Treat an inactive sing-box service as normal when no nodes are enabled; the first enabled node starts it automatically.
- Fix `sb doctor` exiting at its first warning/failure under `set -e`, and add detailed permission/service diagnostics plus `--repair`.
- Add interactive normal and full-uninstall options, plus `--yes` automation.
- Add first-download, service lifecycle, doctor completion, and Debian 13 CI regressions.
